# Shaking-Picking

A program to access phone accelerometer and saving values to file.  
This program uses *SensorManager* to get accelerometer for detecting shake motion.  
When detected, shake motion will invoke drawing number function and display the number.  
The approach of detecting shake motion is calculating the difference in acceleration during a period of time.
